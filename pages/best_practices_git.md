# Git Best practice 

::left::

- Use gitignore and only track necessary files
- Separate your simulation program from simulation results
- Keep commit small, and commit frequently
- Keep branching simple, and as short life as possible
- Tag your code when necessary
- setup github action to automate building and testing jobs if possible
