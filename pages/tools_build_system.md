# Tools - Build system

::left::

Available systems:
- **<span class="secondary">CMake</span>** <vscode-icons-file-type-cmake/>
- Meson

 
Benefits include:
- Automation (find dependencies)
- Cross-platform (generate vs, xcode, makefile)
- Faster speed (call ninja instead of make)

I **<span class="primary">highly recommend</span>** using CMake for building your code. 

CMake might be daunting to learn at first sight, in the long run using CMake can save you a lot of time doing some repetitive jobs and it also has great integration with most code editors.
